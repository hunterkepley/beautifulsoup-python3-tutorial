# BeautifulSoup Python 3.x Tutorial

There are two files, single_site.py and multiple_sites.py

They are pretty straight forward, the first being for a single site 
and the other showing how to do this with multiple sites.

Each file has comments explaining every step, and it's pretty simple as it is.

The tutorial (that doesn't work, and has some syntax differences from 
Python 3) is [here!](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-scrape-websites-with-python-and-beautifulsoup-5946935d93fe)

## Requisites

You need just one, BeautifulSoup!

`pip3 install BeautifulSoup4`

Or, if you're using a windows machine like I was when making this;

`py -m pip install BeautifulSoup4`

After that you should be golden.
